## Problem Statement:
Goodcabs, a cab service company, operates in 10 tier-2 cities in India and supports local drivers while providing excellent service to passengers. The company has set ambitious growth and passenger satisfaction targets for 2024. 

The Chief of Operations needs immediate insights into key performance metrics, including trip volume, passenger satisfaction, repeat passenger rate, trip distribution, and the balance between new and repeat passengers. 

However, due to the analytics manager's unavailability, the task has been assigned to me, to analyze these metrics and deliver actionable insights.


## Goal & Purpose:
The goal of this project is to deliver actionable insights on Goodcabs' performance in 10 "tier-2" cities by analyzing key metrics,

- Identify growth opportunities by understanding trip trends. 
- Enhance passenger satisfaction through targeted improvements. 
- Boost customer retention by increasing repeat passenger rates. 
- Optimize operations by balancing new and repeat passenger engagement. 
- Support strategic decision-making to achieve 2024 performance targets. 

## Data Source:

## Primary Analysis: 

1. Identify the top 3 and bottom 3 cities by total trips over the entire analysis period.
![image](https://github.com/Madhusmeetam/Resume-Project-Challenge-13/blob/main/Images/pq1.png?raw=true)


2. Calculate the average fare per trip for each city and compare it with the city's average trip distance. Identify the cities with the highest and lowest average fare per trip to assess pricing efficiency across locations.

4. For each city, identify the month with the highest total trips (peak demand) and the month with the lowest total trips (low demand). 

![image](https://github.com/Madhusmeetam/Resume-Project-Challenge-13/blob/main/Images/pq4.png?raw=true)


5. Compare the total trips taken on weekdays versus weekends for each city over the six-month period. Identify cities with a strong preference for either weekend or weekday trips to understand demand variations.

6. Identify which cities contribute most to higher trip frequencies among repeat passengers, and examine if there are distinguishable patterns between tourism-focused and business-focused cities.

 ![image](https://github.com/Madhusmeetam/Resume-Project-Challenge-13/blob/main/Images/pq6.png)


7. For each city, evaluate monthly performance against targets for total trips, new passengers, and average passenger ratings. Determine if each metric met, exceeded, or missed the target, and calculate the percentage difference.

![image](https://github.com/Madhusmeetam/Resume-Project-Challenge-13/blob/main/Images/pq7.png)


8. Identify the top 2 and bottom 2 cities based on their RPR% to determine which locations have the strongest and weakest rates. Similarly, analyze the RPR% by month across all cities and identify the months with the highest and lowest repeat passenger rates.

## Secondary Analysis:

1. Factors Influencing Repeat Passenger Rates

- Passenger Satisfaction: Higher repeat passenger rates often align with better ratings, reflecting quality service.
Competitive Pricing: Affordable fares attract more repeat passengers in price-sensitive cities.
Socioeconomic Trends: Premium services appeal to high-income groups, while cost-effective options suit lower-income areas.
Lifestyle Habits: IT hubs or professional cities see consistent repeat usage during weekdays due to work commutes.

2. Tourism vs. Business Demand Impact

- Event Correlation: Trip data linked to event calendars shows demand spikes during festivals and tourism seasons.
-Tourism Hotspots: Cities like Jaipur and Kochi see increased rides during festive seasons or vacation periods.
-Business Hubs: Cities like Lucknow and Surat exhibit steady weekday demand driven by professional commutes.


3. Emerging Mobility Trends and Goodcabs' Adaptation

-Analyze developments in mobility needs, passenger preferences for green energy, and the uptake of electric vehicles. 
-Adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs): Tier-2 cities are increasingly choosing environmentally friendly transportation. EVs have the potential to save operating expenses and attract eco-aware travelers.
-Sustainability Focus: Low-emission and ride-sharing solutions are preferred by environmentally aware travelers


4. Partnership Opportunities with Local Businesses

-Partner with Hotels: Provide reliable transportation for guests, gaining consistent demand from tourists and business travelers.
-Collaborate with Shopping Malls: Offer discounts for rides to malls, boosting foot traffic and ride bookings during peak hours.
-Tie-Up with Event Venues: Ensure on-demand rides for events, leveraging high-volume bookings and exclusive promo codes.
-Tourism Partnerships: Work with travel agencies to offer curated packages like city tours, ensuring steady demand during tourist seasons.
-Loyalty Programs: Reward customers with points redeemable at partner businesses, enhancing loyalty for both brands.
-Dedicated Branding Zones: Set up branded pickup/drop-off points at malls, hotels, and event venues for visibility.
-Integrate Technology: Enable seamless cab bookings via partner apps with in-app promotions and discounts.


5. Data Collection for Enhanced Data-Driven Decisions

-Understand Customer Behavior: Track ride history, preferences, and feedback to improve satisfaction, identify loyalty trends, and address churn through personalized services.
-Improve Operational Efficiency: Monitor driver performance, ride fulfillment, and fleet utilization while reducing downtime with real-time GPS tracking and automated maintenance logs.
-Stay Ahead with Market Trends: Analyze seasonal demand, competitive pricing, and demographic insights to adapt services and create tailored promotions for specific customer groups.

## Recommendations:

- Focus on improving service quality and offering personalized pricing plans for cities with lower repeat rates.
- Tailor marketing efforts to highlight tourism-related campaigns in high-demand periods and offer flexible services for business travelers e.g., loyalty program, ride packages for conferences.
- Gradually integrate electric or hybrid vehicles in tier-2 cities to stay competitive and consider offering discounts on eco-friendly rides.
- Collaborate with local businesses to offer joint promotions for e.g., free rides for shopping above a certain spend.
- Establish partnerships with event venues for exclusive discounts or bundled deals.
- Invest in a feedback system to collect qualitative data on passenger satisfaction and driver performance. Use predictive analytics to optimize supply-demand matching.
